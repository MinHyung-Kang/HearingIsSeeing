How to run
=====================================================

To train  :
1. Edit the CONFIG file as necessary to indicate the directory of the data file
2. Edit scripts/train_instruments.sh accordingly if necessary

Then run by :  [ scripts/train_instruments.sh]

To generate : 
1. Edit scripts/audiofeatures.txt to select which audio inputs to use.
2. Edit scripts/demo_instruments.sh to select which model to use to generate.
3. Edit aud2img_demo_simp.lua if necessary.

Then run by : [ scripts/demo_instruments.sh]

=====================================================
Models
=====================================================
For training, there are various options.
Depending on which structure one wants to use, change the called file in scripts/train_instruments.sh

1. a2i_main_cls_int.lua : Original text to image structure.
2. a2i_main_wasgna.lua : Original text to image network structure with wasgan objective function. 
3. a2i_main_wasgan_simple.lua : Simplified network structure with wasgan objective function. Allows initialization with pretrained wasgan model. 

=====================================================
Notes
=====================================================
Apart from parameters, the important paramters to change within models include :

'img_dir', 'data_root', 'classnames', 'trainids','checkpoint_dir'

These are currently set up in relative path respect to the model files.
They might need to be changed to absolute paths for the code to run.

=====================================================
Modifications
=====================================================
Main modifications include
- Incorporating Wasserstein objective function and allowing initialization with pretrained wasserstein GAN
- Saving the statistics of training

Other minor modifications were made as well.
